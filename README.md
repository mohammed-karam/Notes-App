# üìù Flutter Notes App

The **Flutter Notes App** is a lightweight and offline-first mobile application that enables users to create, edit, and manage personal notes with ease. Built using **Flutter** for the UI, **Hive** for fast and secure local storage, and **BLoC** for efficient state management, it ensures smooth performance and maintainable code. All notes are stored locally, allowing full functionality without an internet connection. The project structure includes organized folders for blocs, models, pages, and widgets to keep the codebase clean and scalable. To run the app, simply clone the repository, install dependencies with `flutter pub get`, and launch it using `flutter run`. Future enhancements will include note search, trash/undo delete functionality, categories and tags, and optional cloud sync for multi-device access.
